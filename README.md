This project was completed for my final, term long project for my Data Analytics Course at Georgian Court University. 
My goal for this project was to give investory a rough idea of how the price of a given stock can change throughout its future, using its past price as a point of reference.
While this project makes some assumptions, such as anomamlies that could affect a stocks price, this algorithm takes the previous 36 months of a given stocks price, using 
the price of the stock on the first of the month, and stores the percent change in a list. This algorithm is using the assumption that, in the future, a stock could change by any of the 
percentages that it has changed by in the past. The stock that is present in this example is Intel. It was my hopes that anyone would be able to take this script
and with very little changes, be able to see what the price of a stock will be in the future 36 months. The only infomration that a user will have to change is
adding a txt file with the previous 36 months for the stock they choose, and edit the file name in the main script. From there the user will have to update
the chart titles and the chart file names that are saved to accurately represent the stock they are trying to find the price of.
